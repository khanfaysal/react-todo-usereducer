Here if you follow my another repository then you see I implement already task mini project by useState hook and props also lifting state up.

Here this repository only convert useState to useReducer hook and if you follow two repositories and read my code deeply then you can understand about react fundamental concept like react useState, props, useReducer and lifting state up concept clearly.

Thanks for reading and implementing those mini projects.

Happy coding :blush:
